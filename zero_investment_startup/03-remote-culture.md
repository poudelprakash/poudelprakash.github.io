We are in the age of the Internet and we should not be surprised by the changing trends that are going on around us. One of the increasing trends is remote working.

It may sound like nonsense to an office worker but the popularity of remote working culture is growing rapidly. More and more people are working remotely and not only companies but remote workers are also benefited from working remotely.

According to Global Workplace Analytics, the remote workforce has increased by 140% since 2005.

## What is remote work?

Remote work is a modern-day trend where employees work from outside of the company. They work from home or from a coworking place or from any part of the world as a part-timer or a  full-timer.

According to Owl Labs, 18% of employees work remotely full time.

Remote work is on the rise. And it is not going to stop anytime soon. Why? Because of its cost-efficiency, flexibility in work, capacity to add talented people and so on.

## Traditional workplace to remote working?

People would have never thought that they could work from any part of the world without ever going to the workplace. In the past, people mostly used to engage in the manufacturing process. People used to be dependent on coworkers. In the absence of one, the working process used to halt.

But, now it has changed and people can work from any part of the world. People can work remotely and can work independently. They don’t have to depend on another coworker to finish the task. They can easily collaborate and communicate with fellow members. And this is all because of the Internet. The Internet has changed the way people can work. Advancement in technology has changed the mindset of people towards remote working.

## Why remote work is the future?

Each year more companies are shifting to remote companies. Companies are recognizing the benefits of hiring talented people from different geographical locations. So remote working is gaining momentum in the world.

But why this change? Why is it so appealing?

For people who are trying to start a business, it has provided an opportunity to hire experienced and talented people without having to worry about the difference in time as well as cost. This not only applies to startup business but also to an established company. It is not only about cost or time difference but has other factors that make it so appealing.

Benefits of remote work that make it so appealing are:

### 1. Flexibility

The reason why people like to work remotely is that it offers flexibility. People can work from any part of the world promoting a balance between work and life.  They aren’t restricted to any office rules and regulations. They have the freedom to work without any restrictions. It promotes a flexible lifestyle.

According to Owl Labs, 52% of employees around the world work from home at least once per week.

### 2. Worklife balance

Remote work enhances work-life balance. Remote workers have the freedom to choose time for their work as well as give time to their families. It makes the employee happy. As a result, it boosts productivity as well as reduces stress.

According to Owl Labs, 53% of the respondents worldwide feel happy and productive at remote work.

### 3. Boosts performance

Remote work helps to boost the performance of the employees. This can be related to flexibility and work-life balance.  As they have more freedom and less workload stress, it helps in boosting the performance of the employees. Thus helping in higher productivity.

### 4. Cost reduction

Remote work helps in cost reduction of any startup business or an established company. The company doesn't have to worry about their working place, their daily expenses, and so on. Such costs that are saved by hiring a remote worker can be invested in another place.

### 5. Time-saving

Working remotely can help in saving time as remote workers don’t have to commute to work every day. It helps in reducing a commute and thus helps remote workers give extra time for their work and for their family. In return, it helps in avoiding the stress that comes by traveling every day, stuck in traffic, etc. Such situations can be avoided and invest those saved times in another work.

## Drawbacks of remote work
Does remote work have any drawbacks? Of course, it has. Remote work is gaining popularity but it does not mean that it does not come with any drawbacks. Some of the drawbacks of remote working are:

### 1. Communication

One of the drawbacks is communicating with remote workers. Without any methods of communication, it can lead to project failure. Misunderstanding might arise between the remote workers related to the projects in the absence of communication.

### 2. Distraction

Another drawback is that remote workers might face distractions when working from home or from the place they love most. They might face distractions that they don’t usually get working from an office. Sometimes they might have to go to the market, watch tv, look after their family, pick up children from school and so on. Such things distract remote workers from working.

### 3. Isolation

Remote working creates isolation thus resulting in loneliness. We are a human being and we like to have people around us. But working alone can result in loneliness and sometimes can be stressful. Having people around can help to solve the problem they are facing.

### 4. Lack of organization

Another problem faced by remote workers is the lack of organization. If remote workers are working from home or from any other place, it might be difficult to organize a private space for the work. Lots of distraction factors might occur while working remotely.

### 5. Time zone differences

One of the main drawbacks can be remote workers working in different time zone. The project manager might have to wake up at midnight because of differences in time zone. The team members may not always be available whenever needed. This can really be a critical situation for any company.

## Solutions to remote working problems

So how do we resolve these problems? There are various methods to resolve problems that arise when working remotely. So here are some of the solutions to these problems.

### 1. Communication Tools

Another solution is to use different communication tools to avoid misunderstandings between remote workers. There are various communication tools that are useful for remote teams. Communication tools such as slack, skype, google hangouts, etc can be used to avoid misunderstanding. As a result, these tools help to have clear project vision and goals between the remote workers.

### 2. Include breaks

Another solution is to include breaks in the working schedule. Remote workers don’t have to overexert themselves. Including small breaks between the work can help to relax the mind and body. Thus, helping to avoid stress from the work.

### 3. Time management

The remote workers should be efficient enough to manage their own time. When working remotely, remote workers need to prioritize their work. They need to manage their own time deciding when to give time to the work or time to their family. One of the methods can be creating a to-do-lists that can help to prioritize the work. It also helps to limit the tasks as well.

### 4. Time flexibility with others in different time zone

Remote workers as well as the project manager have to come up with a plan so that communicating with fellow members becomes easier. They can think of a time that overlaps with the fellow member’s working time. This method can help them solve the problem of time zone differences.

Let’s see an example: Suppose a remote worker is working from Nepal and another team member is in the USA. Here they can overlap the working hours and come up with a time that is suitable for both the team members.
