We all living in a dynamic world. Nothing remains the same all the time. Almost everything changes as time passes. And so does the business environment. The business needs to adapt to changes to keep up with the competitors and survive in the market. Change is an important factor that either keeps business alive or dead in the market.

## What is a change in a business?

Business change is a strategy of transforming the business process according to market trends. it is an essential part of the business to cope up with the competition in the market. It includes developmental, transformational, and transitional change.

The different types of business change are:

- **Developmental change**

Developmental change is a type of change that focuses on improving the current business process. These changes are small and take less time to adapt. Such changes include upgrading technology, improving payroll systems and so on. The company should inform its employees about the changes and provide the necessary training to adapt to the changes.

- **Transitional change**

Transitional change is a type of change that focuses on replacing the current business process with a new one. Such changes include introducing new technology in the company, creating new products and services, and so on. Such changes bring fear to the employees about security. So the company should inform about the benefit of such changes and should inform that employees jobs are not in danger.

## What is business agility?

Business agility is a way for businesses to respond to the changes in the market and adapt to the changes. The market is unpredictable. So, businesses should be ready for the changing market environment. Business agility means not to adapt to external changes, but also to adapt internal changes as well. The businesses should respond to these changes quickly to survive in the competitive market.

## Agile manifesto

The **four core values** of Agile manifesto are:

### 1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

For any organization, people are more important than processes and tools. It should value its people that processes and tools. If people work together in an organization, then they can work effectively and use different processes and tools for a smooth development process. If people understand each other and work effectively, then they can solve issues and can effectively develop software products using the processes and tools of the organization.

Communication in a team is necessary to understand each other, behavior, working style, etc so that misunderstanding does not arise. This way the results achieved by the team is the most satisfying one.


### 2. Working software over comprehensive documentation

The second value states that working software is more important than comprehensive documentation. The most important for anyone is to have working software rather than documentation. Documentation is also important as it helps users to know about the system and working method. But, now people mostly prefer working software that fulfills their needs and requirements.


### 3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

The organization main goal is to satisfy its customers. This can be achieved if a software product is developed that satisfies their needs and requirements. So this value state that customer should be involved in the development process. Customers know what to expect from the software product. So, customer involved in the process helps to develop a successful software product.

### 4. Responding to change over following a plan

According to agile, change is an important part of software development. As the development process progresses, the client will be able to understand the problem domain and can change the requirements if necessary. Clients are involved in the development process. It helps to get feedback from the clients, can improve the software, and provide additional value. So, the development process must be agile because the requirements can change anytime and implement the change accordingly.

There are **12 principles** in Agile Manifesto which are as follows:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Why agile methodology is important for startups?

Agile methodology is a process in which requirements evolve throughout the software development process.  It is based on iterative development. Since the requirement of clients changes, the organization needs to continuously improve the development process. And it most important for any business. So, here are some of the importance of agile methodology.

### 1. Adapts to change quickly

Agile methodology runs in a small sprint and is based on iterative development. It helps in managing changing requirements. Since clients are also involved in the development process, it helps to get constant feedback from the clients. The development team then can add additional features according to the changing requirements.

### 2. Saves time

Agile methodology ensures that the project is completed within the deadline with the use of optimal resources. Constant feedback from the clients during the development process helps to improve the software. So, this helps to save time and effort since the necessary improvements are finished before the release of the software products.

### 3. Improves quality

Agile methodology helps in improving the quality of software products. Adapting to change quickly helps to improve the quality of software products. Constant feedback from the clients during the development process helps to adapt to changing requirements. As a result, this helps to improve quality during the software development process.

### 4. Employee engagement

Agile methodology is not a lengthy process and employee can quickly learn and starts implementing it. Agile methodology also involves daily stand-ups. Stand-ups gives information on what employees worked on today and what are the targets for tomorrow. This helps employees to interact with other team members. And also helps to know the scope of the projects.

According to different surveys, remote work is increasing at a rapid pace. Since remote workers are more productive, most of the companies are hiring remote workers. Some companies are shifting to remote companies as well.


- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

Artificial intelligence is a branch of science that focuses on creating human-like intelligence in machines. The AI can make a decision, recognize patterns, walk and talk like humans. AI is now used extensively for businesses. AI here is about software that is used in marketing tools, analytics tools, mobile devices, laptops, and so on.

But hyper-personalization also considers browsing history and real-time data. Based on this data, the business recommends products and services according to customer's needs and preferences. For example, the recommendation of similar or related products while browsing Amazon or other e-commerce sites or applications.


- **Rise of subscription services**

The subscription services are increasing rapidly. It is a business service in which customers have to pay some amount monthly or yearly on the basis of the subscription plan. Customers who pay for subscription services are called subscribers. It is convenient for customers as they don’t have to worry about products. They will receive products and services because they have paid for it as a subscriber. This helps in building strong relationships with customers.
