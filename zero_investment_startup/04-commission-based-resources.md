Starting a business? Well, there are many small companies as well as large companies that are well-established in the market. Competing with these companies is not going to be as easy.

Looking at the current situation, almost everyone wants to start their own company. One of the problems of any startup business is to compete with established companies in the market. People have the idea to start a business but the main problem is investing money to start one.

One has to know about what their visions and goals are. Without knowing what business to get into, it’s going to be really tough to travel ahead and reach the destination.

This article gives information on commission based resources that help in starting a business without investing capital.

## What is a commission-based payment?

Commission-based payment is a process of paying less than the amount taken from the client for hiring a developer for the project.

Suppose,  a company takes a project from a client. And what that company does is that it hires a freelancer for the project. The freelancer has a fixed rate. But the company takes more money from the clients which is more than the amount required to hire a freelancer. And the company gives the required amount to the freelancer which is less than the amount taken from the client. In this process, the company gains a certain amount of money as a commission without anyone noticing.

## How does commission-based payment works?

Let’s understand this with an example, let’s say the company takes $500 from the clients to hire a freelancer to complete the project. But the fixed rate of the freelancer is $300. The company hires that particular freelancer for $300 and $200 becomes extra profit or we can say commission for the company. This extra amount is taken by the company without anyone noticing. This way it helps any company to functions its operations smoothly. If the freelancers are satisfied, this can lead the freelancer to be dedicated to working with the company in the future too. And the commissioned money can also be used in building an in-house development team for the company.

This is how commission-based payments work for the company and help in operating its functions smoothly.
