Sometimes we may need to share same enum values in multiple columns in rails. For eg:
I may have a model named file that can either be of type transfer or new, and can be in transfer, review or approved state.
I now have both state and type as enum and my modal looks like this:

```ruby
class File < ActiveRecord::Base
  enum :state [ :transfer, :review, :approved]
  enum :type [ :transfer, :new]
end
```
ActiveRecord provides us some helper methods like bang and predicate methods for enums and in this case `File.last.transfer!`
would probably not work as we have two transfer to resolve to, hence this won't work.
As mentioned in [official doc](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html) we can make it work using prefix or suffix with enum.
Above code can be fixed as:

## Using suffix
We can either pass boolean or some value so that helper methods are still valid.

```ruby
class File < ActiveRecord::Base
  enum :state [ :transfer, :review, :approved], _suffix: :step  #providing some value for suffix
  enum :type [ :transfer, :new], _suffix: true, _suffix: true #providing boolean value
end
```
Now our helper methods would look like:

```sh
file.transfer_step?, file.transfer_step!
file.transfer_type?, file.transfer_type!
```

## Define prefix

```ruby
class File < ActiveRecord::Base
  enum :state [ :transfer, :review, :approved], _prefix: :step  #providing some value for suffix
  enum :type [ :transfer, :new], _suffix: true, _prefix: true #providing boolean value
end
```
How this works is similar to above except defined words will come at first in helper methods
(that is simply the difference of prefix and suffix)

Now our helper methods would look like:

```sh
file.step_transfer?, file.step_transfer!
file.type_transfer?, file.type_transfer!
```
