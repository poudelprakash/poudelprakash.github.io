Do you remember we talked about ruby's send method [here]({{ site.url }}/using-send-method-in-ruby-to-refactor-conditional/). It is used to call a ruby function from string having same value as function name.

There is js equivalent of the same:

~~~js
// defining the function
var apple = function(){
	console.log('apple');
}

eval('apple()') // => apple
~~~
