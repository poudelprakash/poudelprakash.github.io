Why would anyone want to do that?

Well I now have a reason, My laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 suddenly started crashing. On 15th March it crashed more than 10 times.

I tried to figure out what had happened to my normally functioning machine all of a sudden. I had installed regular update early in the morning that day. Turns out that, I had updated my kernel to 3.13.0-83. That was only software installed that day, and if my laptop was crashing for software reasons there was only one possible culprit!

Thus I rebooted my machine, and selected older kernel version from my grub menu to start ubuntu. It worked normally.

Now I was sure my new linux kernel was giving all the problems, I had to uninstall it.
Here is how I did that:

**Step 1: List all the kernels installed in the system**

~~~sh
$ dpkg --list | grep linux-image

ii  linux-image-3.13.0-24-generic                         3.13.0-24.47                                        amd64        Linux kernel image for version 3.13.0 on 64 bit x86 SMP
ii  linux-image-3.13.0-83-generic                         3.13.0-83.127                                       amd64        Linux kernel image for version 3.13.0 on 64 bit x86 SMP
rc  linux-image-4.4.0-13-generic                          4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1                                 amd64        Linux kernel image for version 4.4.0 on 64 bit x86 SMP
ii  linux-image-extra-3.13.0-24-generic                   3.13.0-24.47                                        amd64        Linux kernel extra modules for version 3.13.0 on 64 bit x86 SMP
ii  linux-image-extra-3.13.0-83-generic                   3.13.0-83.127                                       amd64        Linux kernel extra modules for version 3.13.0 on 64 bit x86 SMP
ii  linux-image-generic                                   3.13.0.83.89                                        amd64        Generic Linux kernel image

**Step 2: Remove kernel you don't want anymore**

{: .notice}
Okay, before moving further! If you are trying to do something like this please make sure you don't remove all your kernels. Leave atleast one: probably the one that works for you. In my case I wanted to keep 3.13.0-24.

I removed buggy kernel version 3.13.0-83.

~~~sh
$ sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.13.0-83-generic
~~~
Here is the output I could see in my screen when I removed my kernel:

~~~sh
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  kde-l10n-engb libechonest2.1 libqtweetlib1.0
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  linux-generic* linux-image-3.13.0-83-generic*
