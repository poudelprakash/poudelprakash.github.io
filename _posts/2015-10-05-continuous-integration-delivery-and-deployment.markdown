## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

**Example:**
*Suppose there is a dev branch where all the features get merged before they are moved to master(production branch), then integrating code into this dev branch frequently is continuous integration.*

This helps:

1. catch issues early
2. prevent "integration hell"

>Continuous Integration doesnâ€™t get rid of bugs, but it does make them dramatically easier to find and remove. - Martin Fowler

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery is the practice of delivery of code to an environment, whether it is a QA team or customers, so they can review it. After the changes get approved, they can land in production.

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment is closely related to Continuous Integration and refers to keeping your application deployable at any point or even automatically releasing to a test or production environment if the latest version passes all automated tests.
