If you are only interested in the packages installed globally without the full TREE then:

`npm -g ls --depth=0`

or locally (omit -g) :

`npm ls --depth=0`

`npm list` also can be used instead of `npm ls`.Then code would look like:
`npm list -g --depth=0`

Excluding depth will give you tree to show all packages with their respective dependencies.
