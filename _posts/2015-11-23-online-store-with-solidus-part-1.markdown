Since spree has been sold, I thought it might be good idea to setup tutorial to create ecommerce with alternative.

Here we will use [solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus){: rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} which is a complete open source e-commerce solution built with Ruby on Rails. It is a fork of Spree.

## New Rails Project

Lets start with setting up new rails project.

```bash
rails _4.2.6_ new merchant -T -B --database=mysql
# -T skips unit test (we will use rspec)
# -B skips the bundle install after all files have been generated
# --database=mysql specifies database to be used is mysql
```

Now `cd` to the project directory and let's init git

```bash
cd merchant
git init
```

You may copy .gitignore content from [here](/setup-new-rails-project/){:target="_blank"} to avoid tracking unnecessary files to your repo.

Create `.ruby-version` to specify ruby version.

```bash
echo '2.3.1' > .ruby-version
```

# Adding Solidus gem

Now let's add solidus to our gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus'
gem 'solidus_auth_devise'
```

Run the `bundle` command to install.

```bash
$ bundle
```

After installing gems, let's setup database. My config/database.yml looks like this:

```yml
default: &default
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8
  pool: 5
  username: root
  password:
  socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

development:
  <<: *default
  database: merchant_development
test:
  <<: *default
  database: merchant_test
production:
  <<: *default
  database: merchant_production
  username: merchant
  password: <%= ENV['MERCHANT_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

Now you need to run `rake db:create' command to create database.

For me this command failed as ActiveRecord command could not support `gem mysql2 0.4.1` hence I switched to `0.3.15`
{: .notice}

Then, you'll have to run the generators to create necessary configuration files and migrations.

```bash
bundle exec rails g spree:install
```

This may take a while but after some time you will be prompted to create admin user. Enter email and password and youe will see success message.

```bash
Create the admin user (press enter for defaults).
Email [spree@example.com]: prakashpoudel@lftechnology.com
Password [spree123]:
Done!
     loading  sample data
      insert  config/routes.rb
**************************************************
We added the following line to your application's config/routes.rb file:

    mount Spree::Core::Engine, :at => '/'
**************************************************
Spree has been installed successfully. You're all ready to go!

Enjoy!

```

The line below is copied from solidus's instruction and I expected it to copy migrations to my app but my terminal gave me no hint what it did! Then I ran `rake db:migrate` and again terminal gave no hint of what was happening but I guess that won't cause me problem because `bundle exec rails g spree:install` has already installed necessary migrations.

```bash
bundle exec rake railties:install:migrations
```

Let's see the output of our hardwork now! Run rails server!

```bash
rails s
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000/>{: rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} to see your store. <br />Your admin section will be in <http://localhost:3000/admin>{: rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}

![solidus store]({{ "/assets/images/posts/solidus.png" | absolute_url }})

We will do slight customisations of this store in next post.
