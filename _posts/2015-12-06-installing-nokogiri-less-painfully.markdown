If you don't care about my story and just want that damn easy solutions you should skip to TLDR; section at the end of this post. Leave a comment if that doesn't work for you.

## Story-telling

I think I have already faced this pain of installing nokogiri multiple times in my journey as rails developer. This time let me document whatever I do for successful installation so that my future self will have a good place of reference.

While writing this post, latest nokogiri version is 1.6.7

## Let's install nokogiri together

So here I begin with installing nokogiri skipping documentations.

```bash
gem install nokogiri -q --no-rdoc --no-ri
```

Yeeaaah! got the error!

```bash
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing nokogiri:
	ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

Gem files will remain installed in /home/prakash/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/nokogiri-1.6.7 for inspection.

```

I don't actually care about that really long error! I have figured out, it's about missing dependency. So here I try something from suggestions @ stack overflow.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev
```

But some errors persist. So now I follow [nokogiri instructions for ubuntu](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#ubuntu___debian)

```ruby
# make sure you have all the tooling necessary to compile C extensions
sudo apt-get install build-essential patch

# this is final try to fix dependencies
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev zlib1g-dev
```

After that I again tried installing nokogiri:
`gem install nokogiri -q --no-rdoc --no-ri`
And this time it installs without any problem.

## TLDR;

```bash
# install all dependencies
sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev ruby-dev zlib1g-dev

# install the nokogiri
gem install nokogiri -q --no-rdoc --no-ri
```
